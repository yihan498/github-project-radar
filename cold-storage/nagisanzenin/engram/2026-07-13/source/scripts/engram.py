Engram state engine — the deterministic core of the Engram learning plugin.

All scheduling math, state transitions, and evidence (receipts) live here.
The LLM never computes dates or stability values; it calls this CLI (Article 10:
receipts or it didn't happen; the oracle is never a vibe).

Scheduler: FSRS-4.5 (open-spaced-repetition), with an optional per-user
interval multiplier fitted by `refit` once enough review evidence exists.

Stdlib only. State lives in ~/.claude/learning (override: ENGRAM_HOME).
Test hooks: ENGRAM_TODAY=YYYY-MM-DD freezes "today"; `selftest` runs in a tempdir.

    # v0.8.1 — THREE BUGS LIVED IN THESE FOUR LINES, all found by the post-release reviewer:
    #
    #  1. `--replace` DESTROYED a completed capstone's schedule. The architect's payload never
    #     contains a capstone (it is popped at ingest), so `_has_capstone` was ALWAYS false on a
    #     replace and the capstone was ALWAYS re-minted with `state: new, fsrs: fresh` — after
    #     the carry-forward loop, so it was the one surviving node never carried forward. And it
    #     flattered: the reset removed the rotting capstone from `retention.unmeasured`, so
    #     "1 concept past due and unretrieved" became "30-day recall 100%". Survivorship bias,
    #     through a new door.
    #  2. `--replace` wiped `node.transfer` and never rebuilt it (unlike `artifact`, which is
    #     recomputed from evidence). Graph said `None`; `stats` still said `applied: 1`.
    #  3. A payload node legitimately named `capstone` was SILENTLY overwritten — and the minted
    #     capstone then listed ITSELF in `requires`, so it could never be served, while `next`
    #     cheerfully reported "this topic is finished".

    # mature node — the only kind the system ever probes — one failed transfer probe did this:
    #
    #     s: 443.5 -> 12.3      (97% of the memory's durability, deleted)
    #     state: review -> learning     lapses: 0 -> 1     due: 2027-03-01 -> 2026-03-17
    #
    # …and dropped the node below the transfer bar, so it could never be re-probed. **Answering a
    # HARDER question wrong demolished the schedule for the ORIGINAL concept.** It contradicted
    # three separate sentences this very release shipped:
    #
    #   skills/review  — "A lapse here is NOT a memory failure and must never be framed as one."
    #   skills/coach   — "A transfer lapse is not a memory failure. Do not frame it as a setback."
    #   _transfer_ready — "failing it would be a lapse the schedule then punishes — A FABRICATED
    #                      SETBACK." (The maturity gate was built to prevent exactly this, and
    #                      only ever guarded IMMATURE nodes.)
    #
    # The learner remembers the concept. The capability just did not fire. Those are different
    # facts about different things, and the schedule is only allowed to hear about the first.

# ============================================================= THE METHOD (v0.9)
# Article 7 ("adapt on evidence, never taxonomy") is the article that replaces learning styles
# with real n-of-1 measurement — and the machinery implementing it was not sound enough to
# support the claims it exists to make. Four defects, all of them in the shipped code:
#
#   1. `arm = arms[len(assignments) % len(arms)]`  -> ROUND-ROBIN, not randomized. Perfectly
#      predictable, and therefore assignable by anything that knows the order things happen in.
#   2. Unstratified -> `docs/06` open-Q2 already documented the consequence: explorables are
#      routed to the hardest concepts ON PURPOSE, so the medium comparison carries the MATERIAL
#      as well as the medium. The document disclosed the confound honestly. It did not fix it.
#   3. `min_per_arm: 6` -> the SCED alternating-treatments literature puts sufficient power at
#      ~28-30 observations. Six per arm is underpowered by roughly 2.5x (`docs/07` §9).
#   4. `exp["verdict"] = args.verdict` -> **THE MODEL COMPUTED THE VERDICT.** A payload said
#      "derivation-first won" and the engine wrote it down. That is a direct violation of
#      invariant #2 — *the engine owns every number* — in the one command whose entire purpose
#      is to produce a number nobody is allowed to make up.
#
# A confounded, unpowered, round-robin trial settled by narration is not evidence. It is a
# vibe with a JSON file.

    A `kind: review` receipt that is NOT its node's first — because a node's first receipt is
    its ENCODING event whatever it is labelled, and a first exposure cannot be a retention test.

    v0.6.1 established that principle in `_by_node` (which feeds `adherence` and `retention`)
    and left `stats.reviews`, `compute_momentum`, `compute_modality` and the calibration split
    filtering on `kind == "review"` **directly** — four implementations of one rule, three of
    them wrong. A bare CLI `rate` (argparse default `kind="review"`) on a never-encoded node
    therefore inflated `stats.reviews`, and — worse — handed `compute_modality` an *encoding*
    receipt as that node's "first review", corrupting the medium telemetry `docs/06` exists to
    produce. `adherence` said 0 reviews while `stats` said 1, on the same state.

    One predicate. Used everywhere. (RELEASE_PROTOCOL §4.8 Q1: the engine's own commands must
    agree with each other.)

    ── THE THREE POPULATIONS (v0.8), because there are now genuinely three questions ──

    v0.6.4's bug was FOUR implementations of ONE rule, three of them wrong. The fix was one
    shared predicate. v0.8 adds a second KIND of retrieval, and the temptation is to bolt it
    onto the same predicate — which would be the same bug from the other end: ONE definition
    covering THREE questions, and therefore answering none of them.

    | `_retrieval_receipts`   | how much durability was actually grown?     | momentum |

    They are NOT interchangeable, and pooling any two of them silently answers a question
    nobody asked. Retention pooled with transfer would drag the north star down with a harder

# ============================================================== THE ORACLE (v0.7)
# The blind assessor's grade drives mastery, retention, calibration, and the schedule
# itself — and until now its agreement with any ground truth was UNMEASURED. If it is
# lenient, every number Engram has ever printed is inflated and nothing in the system
# could discover it. The constitution says "the oracle is never a vibe"; it has been one.
#
# Three numbers from the literature shape every threshold below (docs/07 §3):
#   - LLM judges hit kappa 0.376-0.511 vs human ground truth. Moderate. Well under 0.70.
#   - Raw agreement OVERSTATES chance-corrected agreement by 33.8-41.2 points. So raw
#     agreement is a liar and is never allowed to be the headline. QWK is the headline.
#   - THE PARADOX: one measured judge scored test-retest 0.992 with position bias 0.192 —
#     perfectly reproducible and systematically wrong. High self-consistency is NOT
#     evidence of correctness, and Engram's assessor prompt (skeptic, round down, cite the
#     rubric) selects for exactly that profile. So consistency alone can never certify.

# transfer receipts exist anywhere, ever. Engram has been a very good memory system wearing
# a capability system's marketing, and `skills/learn` §5 says of the transfer step: "this is
# the point of the whole topic — do not let it silently not happen." It silently did not happen.
#
# A node is RETAINED when recall survives a month. It is OWNED when it fires on a probe that
# wears different clothes. Those are two different claims, backed by two different pieces of

# ⚠ THE INSTRUMENT'S OWN LIMIT — v0.7's most important finding, and it is not a number.
#
# v0.7.0 shipped this gold set and published QWK 0.93. Then a post-release reviewer measured the
# thing nobody had thought to measure: it ran a CORRECT grader and a deliberately FOOLED one
# against the set — and **the fooled grader scored higher** (1.000 vs 0.990). The gold set was
# REWARDING leniency. The instrument was inverted.
#
# The cause was five lenient adjudications by the set's own author, all of the same kind:
# crediting an ADJACENT FACT as partial credit. Majority is not intersection. Consonance is not
# pitch-set arithmetic. The history of a theory is not its mechanism. The grader had caught every
# one of them, 3 runs out of 3 — including on a `fluent-but-empty` item, which means **the author
# was fooled by fluency in the very category built to catch being fooled by fluency.**
#
# Correcting them lifts agreement 0.889 -> 0.965. **That rise is not evidence the grader got
# better. It is evidence the instrument had been measuring the AUTHOR'S inconsistency.** And
# because the corrections were prompted by the grader's own disagreements, the QWK that follows
# is CIRCULAR: an authored gold set cannot validate a grader from the same model family, because
# when the two disagree and the author concedes, the agreement that follows measures only the
# author's willingness to concede. (One real disagreement, g_054, is deliberately KEPT — an
# independent reviewer judged the gold defensible there. An instrument with no disagreement left
# in it measures nothing.)
#
# So the engine says this on every audit, until someone who is not the author has adjudicated the
# set. §4.8 Q4, turned on the instrument itself: a limit only the docs know is a limit nobody reads.
#
# **What survives — and is STRONGER for the correction:** `direction.graded_up`. Every authoring
# error was LENIENT, so fixing them moved the bar DOWN, giving the grader more room to be caught
# inflating. Across 198 blind judgments it still graded UP exactly zero times. That is a safety
# property, it does not depend on the gold being perfectly calibrated, and it is the only claim
# here that was ever worth a badge.

    # measured the same way.
    # ── THE HEADLINE IS *CURRENT OWNERSHIP*, NOT A LIFETIME POOL ────────────────────────────
    #
    # v0.8.0's `rate_fired` pooled the **entire append-only lifetime log** and was **ORDER-BLIND**
    # — while `node.transfer.state` was deliberately latest-evidence, with a docstring saying
    # *"a capability that fired in June and failed in September is not currently owned, and
    # pretending otherwise would be a wrong number in the flattering direction."*
    #
    # They fixed it in `state` and shipped it in the number `/coach` leads with:
    #
    #   IMPROVING learner (failed 5 twice, then mastered all 5) -> owns 5 -> "FIRED on 33%"
    #   DECLINING learner (passed 5 twice, then LOST all 5)     -> owns 0 -> "FIRED on 67%"
    #
    # **The learner with ZERO current capability scored exactly DOUBLE the one who owned all five**
    # — and the dashboard rendered `fired 67%` and `owned 0` as adjacent chips. That is not a
    # lenient ruler; it is a NEGATIVE one, and every number downstream had its sign flipped.

    # The shipped §5.5 instrument gate missed it because it varied the BAR (recalled/partial/
    # lapsed on one node, one receipt) and never varied the POPULATION. **It tested the subject,

# ============================================================ THE COMMONS (v1.0)
# The evidence base of learning science is built on undergraduates, word pairs, and 20-minute
# retention intervals. **Almost nothing tests self-directed adults, on hard conceptual material,
# at 30-90 day horizons, with blind-graded free recall.** Engram produces exactly that data as a
# byproduct of being useful — and, since v0.7, with a MEASURED oracle behind every grade.
#
# ── THE PROMISE, AND WHY IT IS STRUCTURAL RATHER THAN TRUSTED ──────────────────────────────
#
# 1. **The engine never grows a socket.** `export` writes a FILE and stops. The *agent* — which
#    already has Bash and is already trusted with the machine — does the posting, via `gh`, only
#    after an explicit human yes. The 100%-local badge stays true because the thing it is about
#    (`engram.py`) contains zero network code, and a permanent selftest proves it on every run.
#
# 2. **The payload is a WHITELIST.** Not "we remembered to delete the productions" — *there is no
#    code path by which a production could arrive.* Every field is constructed by name. A field
#    added to a receipt in v1.1 cannot leak by being forgotten in a delete-list, which is the
#    same lesson `gold` taught in v0.7 and the reason both are built the same way.
#
# 3. **`stripped` ships INSIDE the file.** The promise is verifiable by the person making it, not
#    merely asserted at them.
#
# 4. **It is ATTRIBUTED, and it says so.** `gh` posts from your account. A "salted anonymous hash"
#    riding inside a signed envelope would be a lie, so Engram does not tell it. Attribution is
#    also the *stronger* design: a retention study lives on LONGITUDINAL LINKAGE — following the
#    same learner across months IS the question — and attributed n=100 beats anonymous n=500.
#
# 5. **An unaudited oracle cannot contribute.** Every shared grade came from the assessor; if
#    nobody has measured it, the data is not evidence, it is noise with a schema. **v0.7 gates
#    v1.0, and the gate is a refusal, not a warning.**
