description: Perform a release-readiness review by locating the previous release tag from remote tags and auditing the diff (e.g., v1.2.3...<commit>) for breaking changes, regressions, improvement opportunities, and risks before releasing openai-agents-python.

# Final Release Review

## Purpose

Use this skill when validating the latest release candidate commit (default tip of `origin/main`) for release. It guides you to fetch remote tags, pick the previous release tag, and thoroughly inspect the `BASE_TAG...TARGET` diff for breaking changes, introduced bugs/regressions, improvement opportunities, and release risks.

The review must be stable and actionable: avoid variance between runs by using explicit gate rules, and never produce a `BLOCKED` call without concrete evidence and clear unblock actions.

## Quick start

1. Ensure repository root: `pwd` → `path-to-workspace/openai-agents-python`.
2. Sync tags and pick base (default `v*`):
   ```bash
   BASE_TAG="$(.agents/skills/final-release-review/scripts/find_latest_release_tag.sh origin 'v*')"
   ```
3. Choose target commit (default tip of `origin/main`, ensure fresh): `git fetch origin main --prune` then `TARGET="$(git rev-parse origin/main)"`.
4. Snapshot scope:
   ```bash
   git diff --stat "${BASE_TAG}"..."${TARGET}"
   git diff --dirstat=files,0 "${BASE_TAG}"..."${TARGET}"
   git log --oneline --reverse "${BASE_TAG}".."${TARGET}"
   git diff --name-status "${BASE_TAG}"..."${TARGET}"
   ```
5. Deep review using `references/review-checklist.md` to spot breaking changes, regressions, and improvement chances.
6. Capture findings and call the release gate: ship/block with conditions; propose focused tests for risky areas.

## Deterministic gate policy

- Default to **🟢 GREEN LIGHT TO SHIP** unless at least one blocking trigger below is satisfied.
- Use **🔴 BLOCKED** only when you can cite concrete release-blocking evidence and provide actionable unblock steps.
- Blocking triggers (at least one required for `BLOCKED`):
  - A confirmed regression or bug introduced in `BASE...TARGET` (for example, failing targeted test, incompatible behavior in diff, or removed behavior without fallback).
  - A confirmed breaking public API/protocol/config change with missing or mismatched versioning and no migration path (for example, patch release for a breaking change).
  - A concrete data-loss, corruption, or security-impacting change with unresolved mitigation.
  - A release-critical packaging/build/runtime path is broken by the diff (not speculative).
- Non-blocking by itself:
  - Large diff size, broad refactor, or many touched files.
  - "Could regress" risk statements without concrete evidence.
  - Not running tests locally.
- If evidence is incomplete, issue **🟢 GREEN LIGHT TO SHIP** with targeted validation follow-ups instead of `BLOCKED`.

## Workflow

- **Prepare**
  - Run the quick-start tag command to ensure you use the latest remote tag. If the tag pattern differs, override the pattern argument (e.g., `'*.*.*'`).
  - If the user specifies a base tag, prefer it but still fetch remote tags first.
  - Keep the working tree clean to avoid diff noise.
- **Assumptions**
  - Assume the target commit (default `origin/main` tip) has already passed `$code-change-verification` in CI unless the user says otherwise.
  - Do not block a release solely because you did not run tests locally; focus on concrete behavioral or API risks.
  - Release policy: routine releases use patch versions; use minor only for breaking changes or major feature additions. Major versions are reserved until the 1.0 release.
- **Map the diff**
  - Use `--stat`, `--dirstat`, and `--name-status` outputs to spot hot directories and file types.
  - For suspicious files, prefer `git diff --word-diff BASE...TARGET -- <path>`.
  - Note any deleted or newly added tests, config, migrations, or scripts.
- **Analyze risk**
  - Walk through the categories in `references/review-checklist.md` (breaking changes, regression clues, improvement opportunities).
  - When you suspect a risk, cite the specific file/commit and explain the behavioral impact.
  - For every finding, include all of: `Evidence`, `Impact`, and `Action`.
  - Severity calibration:
    - **🟢 LOW**: low blast radius or clearly covered behavior; no release gate impact.
    - **🟡 MODERATE**: plausible user-facing regression signal; needs validation but not a confirmed blocker.
    - **🔴 HIGH**: confirmed or strongly evidenced release-blocking issue.
  - Suggest minimal, high-signal validation commands (targeted tests or linters) instead of generic reruns when time is tight.
  - Breaking changes do not automatically require a BLOCKED release call when they are already covered by an appropriate version bump and migration/upgrade notes; only block when the bump is missing/mismatched (e.g., patch bump) or when the breaking change introduces unresolved risk.
- **Form a recommendation**
  - State BASE_TAG and TARGET explicitly.
  - Provide a concise diff summary (key directories/files and counts).
  - List: breaking-change candidates, probable regressions/bugs, improvement opportunities, missing release notes/migrations.
  - Recommend ship/block and the exact checks needed to unblock if blocking. If a breaking change is properly versioned (minor/major), you may still recommend a GREEN LIGHT TO SHIP while calling out the change. Use emoji and boldface in the release call to make the gate obvious.
  - If you cannot provide a concrete unblock checklist item, do not use `BLOCKED`.

## Output format (required)

All output must be in English.

Use the following report structure in every response produced by this skill. Be proactive and decisive: make a clear ship/block call near the top, and assign an explicit risk level (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH) to each finding with a short impact statement. Avoid overly cautious hedging when the risk is low and tests passed.

Always use the fixed repository URL in the Diff section (`https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/compare/...`). Do not use `${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}` or any other template variable. Format risk levels as bold emoji labels: **🟢 LOW**, **🟡 MODERATE**, **🔴 HIGH**.

Every risk finding must contain an actionable next step. If the report uses `**🔴 BLOCKED**`, include an `Unblock checklist` section with at least one concrete command/task and a pass condition.

### Release readiness review (<tag> -> TARGET <ref>)

This is a release readiness report done by `$final-release-review` skill.

### Diff

https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python/compare/<tag>...<target-commit>

### Release call:
**<🟢 GREEN LIGHT TO SHIP | 🔴 BLOCKED>** <one-line rationale>

### Scope summary:
- <N files changed (+A/-D); key areas touched: ...>

### Risk assessment (ordered by impact):
1) **<Finding title>**
   - Risk: **<🟢 LOW | 🟡 MODERATE | 🔴 HIGH>**. <Impact statement in one sentence.>
   - Evidence: <specific diff/test/commit signal; avoid generic statements>
   - Files: <path(s)>
   - Action: <concrete next step command/task with pass criteria>
2) ...

### Unblock checklist (required when Release call is BLOCKED):
1. [ ] <concrete check/fix>
   - Exit criteria: <what must be true to unblock>
2. ...

### Notes:
- <working tree status, tag/target assumptions, or re-run guidance>
```

If no risks are found, include a "No material risks identified" line under Risk assessment and still provide a ship call. If you did not run local verification, do not add a verification status section or use it as a release blocker; note any assumptions briefly in Notes. If the report is not blocked, omit the `Unblock checklist` section.
