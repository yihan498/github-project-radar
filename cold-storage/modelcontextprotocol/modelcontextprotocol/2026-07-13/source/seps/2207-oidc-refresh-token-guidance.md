## Abstract

This proposal provides guidance for MCP implementations regarding refresh token
issuance and requests, particularly when Authorization Servers support the
`offline_access` scope. The `offline_access` scope originated in OIDC but can be
adopted by any OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server as a mechanism to let clients
explicitly request refresh tokens. This SEP clarifies the expected behavior for
both Authorization Servers and MCP Clients when working with this pattern.

## Motivation

MCP's authorization mechanism is based on OAuth 2.1, but many real-world
deployments use Authorization Servers that also implement OpenID Connect (OIDC).
A key difference between pure OAuth and OIDC is how refresh tokens are handled:

- In **pure OAuth 2.1**, there is no standard mechanism for a client to
  explicitly request a refresh token. The Authorization Server determines
  whether to issue one based on the client's capabilities (e.g., the
  `refresh_token` grant type in client metadata) and its own policies.
- In **OIDC** (and Authorization Servers that adopt this convention), the
  `offline_access` scope exists to allow clients to explicitly request refresh
  tokens, in addition to the OAuth logic.

This creates several problems in the MCP ecosystem:

1. **Clients aren't requesting refresh tokens**: Major MCP clients (Cursor,
   Claude, VS Code, etc.) aren't explicitly asking for refresh tokens via the
   `offline_access` scope because they don't know whether the Authorization
   Server supports, expects, or requires it.

2. **Resource servers shouldn't specify `offline_access`**: The `offline_access`
   scope is not a resource-specific scope—it's a concern between the client and
   Authorization Server. Including it in the `WWW-Authenticate` header's `scope`
   parameter or in the Protected Resource Metadata's `scopes_supported` would be
   semantically incorrect since it implies the resource _requires_ refresh
   tokens, which it never would.

3. **Authorization Servers can be inconsistent**: When processing an
   authorization code grant, different Authorization Servers may have different
   behavior when issuing refresh tokens to different clients, especially when
   the client doesn't specify `refresh_token` as a grant type or request the
   `offline_access` scope.

4. **Interoperability gap**: Without this guidance, implementations may behave
   inconsistently, leading to poor user experience (frequent re-authentication)
   or security issues (issuing refresh tokens to clients that can't securely
   store them).

## Specification

### MCP Client Requirements

MCP Clients that intend to use refresh tokens and are capable of storing them
securely **SHOULD** follow these guidelines:

1. **Advertise capability**: Clients **SHOULD** include `refresh_token` in their
   `grant_types` client metadata to indicate they support refresh tokens.

2. **Scope augmentation**: When the client desires a refresh token and the
   Authorization Server metadata contains `offline_access` in its
   `scopes_supported` field, the client **MAY** add the `offline_access` scope
   to the list of scopes from the resource server before making authorization
   requests to the Authorization Server.

3. **No guarantee**: Clients **MUST NOT** assume that advertising support or
   requesting `offline_access` guarantees they will receive a refresh token. The
   Authorization Server retains discretion based on its policies.

### MCP Server (Resource Server) Requirements

MCP Servers (acting as OAuth 2.0 Protected Resources):

1. **SHOULD NOT** include `offline_access` in the `scope` parameter of
   `WWW-Authenticate` headers, as refresh tokens are not a resource requirement.

2. **SHOULD NOT** include `offline_access` in `scopes_supported` in Protected
   Resource Metadata, as it is not a resource-specific scope.

## Rationale

### Why not require `offline_access` in the 401 response?

The `offline_access` scope is fundamentally different from resource-specific
scopes. It represents a client's desire for long-lived access, not a
requirement of the resource. Per
[OAuth 2.1 Section 5.3.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-1-13#section-5.3.1),
the `scope` attribute in `WWW-Authenticate` indicates "the required scope of the
access token for accessing the requested resource." Since the resource doesn't
require `offline_access`, including it would be semantically incorrect.

### Why check client metadata for grant types? Why not always issue refresh tokens?

OAuth 2.1 requires clients to register their supported grant types. A client
that doesn't support the `refresh_token` grant either:

- Cannot securely store refresh tokens
- Has no mechanism to use them

Issuing refresh tokens to such clients wastes Authorization Server resources
(tracking tokens that will never be used) and may pose security risks if the
tokens are leaked.

### Why allow `offline_access` as an alternative signal?

Some Authorization Servers—whether fully OIDC-compliant or simply adopting this
convention—only issue refresh tokens when `offline_access` is explicitly
requested. Supporting this pattern provides a compatible path for such
deployments. Clients can detect Authorization Servers that support this
convention by checking for `offline_access` in `scopes_supported` in the
Authorization Server Metadata and adapt their behavior accordingly.

### Alternative approaches considered

1. **Mandate `offline_access` in resource responses**: Rejected because it
   misrepresents the resource's requirements and creates an anti-pattern.

2. **Always issue refresh tokens**: Rejected because it ignores client
   capabilities and Authorization Server security policies.

3. **Separate OIDC-specific specification**: Rejected in favor of a unified
   approach that works for both pure OAuth and OIDC deployments.

4. **Provide guidance for Authorization Servers**: Rejected in favor of
   relying on OAuth and OIDC specs for this guidance as it can vary.

## Backward Compatibility

This proposal is fully backward-compatible:

- Clients that already request `offline_access` continue to work
- Authorization Servers that already check client capabilities continue to work
- MCP Servers are not required to make any changes
- The guidance is additive and does not change existing required behavior

Implementations that don't follow this guidance may experience suboptimal
behavior (missing refresh tokens or unnecessary token issuance) but will remain
functional.

## Security Implications

### Positive security implications

1. **Reduced token leakage risk**: By not issuing refresh tokens to clients that
   don't advertise support, we reduce the risk of long-lived tokens being stored
   insecurely.

2. **Defense in depth**: The risk-based assessment step gives Authorization Servers
   flexibility to implement additional security controls.

### Considerations

1. **Client metadata may not be sufficient**: Since client metadata is
   self-reported, a malicious actor could register a client claiming
   `refresh_token` grant support to obtain long-lived tokens. Authorization
   Servers MAY use the risk-based assessment step (see Specification) to apply
   additional restrictions—such as domain allowlists, reputation checks, or
   verification requirements—rather than solely relying on client metadata
   claims when deciding whether to issue refresh tokens.

2. **Scope injection**: Clients adding `offline_access` should ensure this
   doesn't interfere with other scope-related logic or create unexpected
   authorization prompts.

## Reference Implementation

Reference implementations demonstrating this guidance will be provided in the
official MCP SDKs:

- **TypeScript SDK**: Client-side `offline_access` scope handling
- **Python SDK**: Client-side `offline_access` scope handling
- **Authorization Server example**: Demonstration of client capability checking
- **Client conformance test**: Allowing for easy validation of SDK implementations

Links to implementations will be added once the SEP is accepted.
